## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Use of flexbox for desktop and for mobile devices.
- Use of @media query
- Version control

### Continued development

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I would like to do the same project using SASS.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor Slack community](https://app.slack.com/client/TCYEB44S2/CDC7K7G1L) - This is an amazing place to check out other people's codes and also to ask question regarding specific challenges.
